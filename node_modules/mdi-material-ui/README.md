This module provides [Material-UI][material-ui] `<SvgIcon />` components for all
[Material Design Icons][md-icons]. This is pretty handy if you use React and Material-UI
to build a web app and run out of icons.

While this module contains wrappers for all icons, alias names are not included. For example, the _plus_ icon is aliased as _add_, but only the _plus_ icon
is exported.

## Installation
```shell
npm install mdi-material-ui@mui-v3 --save
```

## Usage
Every icon is exported with its original name in PascalCase. So `coffee` becomes `Coffee`,
`cloud-print-outline` is exported as `CloudPrintOutline` and so on.

The Material Design _Light_ icons are included in the `/light` subdirectory.

### With tree-shaking
If your environment supports tree-shaking and you are sure that it works fine in your setup, you can simply import the icons as follows:

```js
import { Coffee, Food } from 'mdi-material-ui'
import { Camera, Settings } from 'mdi-material-ui/light'

<Coffee />
<Food />
<Camera />
<Settings />
```

### Without tree-shaking
If your environment doesn't support tree-shaking, you should only import the icons that you actually need in order to ensure that you don't end up bundling _all_ icons.
  
```js
import Coffee from 'mdi-material-ui/Coffee'
import Food from 'mdi-material-ui/Food'
import Camera from 'mdi-material-ui/light/Camera'
import Settings from 'mdi-material-ui/light/Settings'

<Coffee />
<Food />
<Camera />
<Settings />
```
